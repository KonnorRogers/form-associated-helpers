## Installation

First step is to install the helpers.

```bash
npm install form-associated-helpers
```

## Next Steps

With the helpers installed, there are a few paths to take from here. Because the mixins are designed for different levels
of abstraction, there are some "divergent paths" listed below.

[Learn about form associated "states"](/references/understanding-form-states)
